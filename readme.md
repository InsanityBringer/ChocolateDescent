## Chocolate Descent 

A barebones software-rendered focused port of the Descent game.

Building:
See building.txt for details. The project has been successfully built 
on Windows using Visual Studio 2019 and Linux with gnu make and gcc

Running:
Chocolate Descent needs game data to run. At the moment, Chocolate Descent
will only work with HOG and PIG files from Descent's PC commercial release, 
versions 1.4 or 1.5. Chocolate Descent 2 will only work with Descent 2's 
commercial release (PC or Mac), version 1.2.

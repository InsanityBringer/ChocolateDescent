Everything described in this document is in a very early state, and is subject
to change. I'll confess I barely know what I'm doing with CMake, so there's
a number of limitations so far. 

The project can be built on Windows (only tested with Visual Studio 2019),
Linux (Tested with clang and gcc), and macOS (tested with clang).

There are three external libraries, but most are optional.

SDL 2.0.10 - Required on Linux and macOS, Optional on Windows
OpenAL (OpenAL Soft implementation preferred) - Optional
FluidSynth - Optional

There are two Graphics/Input and Audio backends available on Windows. If these
libraries are not present, a native Windows backend provided by dpJudas will be
used. This isn't fully featured at the moment, but I try to keep it compilable.
Only the SDL and OpenAL backends are available on Linux right now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building on Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a step by step outline to building on Windows with CMake-gui. I don't 
know enough about the CLI version to give instructions there, sorry.

1. Point the "Where is the source code" directory at the root ChocolateDescent 
directory, and point the "Where to build the binaries" file field at a provided
build directory. You can do a /build/ subdirectory in the root ChocolateDescent
directory, and it will be properly .gitignored. 

2. Click Generate, and set the generator to a Visual Studio project. Currently,
only building with 2019 is tested, I can't comment on earlier versions working.

3. Set the platform as needed. Fluidsynth, if built through vcpkg, will only
be 32-bit, so you'll have to set the platform to Win32 for it.

4. Click Finish, and wait for the configuration to complete. When it does,
you'll see a number of red fields. Since the library detection code is 
currently spotty, you'll probably need to fill out the fields manually.
Provide the library and include directories for which libraries you wish to 
build with. 

5. When these libraries are filled out, click Configure again to update these
values, and then click Generate to make the project files.

6. Open up the generated solution file in Visual Studio, and then build the
projects as desired. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building on Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the large amount of variances in Linux installations, I can't give a
detailed set of instructions, but here's the basic idea:

-Install desired libraries. All of them should be available through your
current package manager

-Navigate to the source directory and run cmake with a desired build directory
  Unlike the Windows code ATM, the library detection code should find
  the three libraries without any issue, at least they do on my machine
  
-Navigate to the build directory and run make. Assuming everything goes well,
this should produce ChocolateDescent and ChocolateDescent2. You can use

  make ChocolateDescent
  or make ChocolateDescent2
  
to build just one of the projects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building on macOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the libraries depends on which package manager you want to use. For
the purposes of these instructions, I'll assume that's Homebrew.

-Install the libraries for ChocolateDescent:
    brew install sdl2 openal-soft fluidsynth

-Navigate to the source directory and run cmake with a desired build directory.
  NOTE: Cmake does not successfully find the SDL include directory, OpenAL
  include directory, or the OpenAL library, so these need to be passed to the
  cmake call.  For example:
  cmake . -DOPENAL_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/local/Cellar/openal-soft/1.21.1/include/ \
  -DOPENAL_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/Cellar/openal-soft/1.21.1/lib/libopenal.dylib \
  -DSDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.14_1/include/SDL2/

-Navigate to the build directory and run make. Assuming everything goes well,
this should produce ChocolateDescent and ChocolateDescent2. You can use

  make ChocolateDescent
  or make ChocolateDescent2
  
to build just one of the projects.

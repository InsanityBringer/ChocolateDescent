//Logic version affects anything that happens once you're in a game.
//Things like what format of the level will be used are for the data version,
//which is set by the data you loaded. In contrast, for the full game, it
//should be possible to override logic versions to emulate other versions.

//When using the demo data, this will be forced to SHAREWARE.
//Otherwise, it will default to FULL_1_2.

};

//Data version support:
//Data version affects anything related to the game data itself.
//It is set based on what game data is present, and will control how that data
//is loaded, and what features are available.
//There's only two options here, Demo and Full, as all full releases use the same formats.
//This may eventually include Destination Quartzon since while that uses mostly full data,
//the logic is much different.

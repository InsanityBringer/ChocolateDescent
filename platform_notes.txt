macOS platform notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The macOS port of Chocolate Descent includes a granular directory structure
based on the user's home directory.

NOTE: All files are expected to have entirely lowercase filenames.  This may
require some renaming if your original game files (such as from the DOS
version) are all uppercase.

In order to run the game with all the bells and whistles, place your resources
in the following locations:

~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 1
~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 2
This is where your player files, saved games, high scores, and config files are
generated for Descent 1 or Descent 2, respectively.

~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 1/Data
~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 2/Data
This is where the core game data goes.  For Descent 1, that's:
descent.hog
descent.pig

For Descent 2, that's:
alien1.pig
alien2.pig
d2x-h.mvl
d2x-l.mvl
descent2.ham
descent2.hog
descent2.s11
descent2.s22
fire.pig
groupa.pig
hoard.ham
ice.pig
intro-h.mvl
intro-l.mvl
other-h.mvl
other-l.mvl
robots-h.mvl
water.pig

~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 1/Data/Demos
~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 2/Data/Demos
This is where your recorded demo files should be placed.  These files have a
".dem" extension.  Some are included in the retail releases.

~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 1/Data/Missions
~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 2/Data/Missions
This is where mission files should be placed.

For Descent 1, this includes:
All .msn files
All .lvl files
All .rdl files
All .txt files
All .hog files which are not descent.hog

For Descent 2, this includes:
All .mn2 files
All .lvl files
All .rdl files
All .txt files
All .hog files which are not descent2.hog

~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 1/Data/SoundFonts
~/Library/Preferences/Chocolate Descent/Descent 2/Data/SoundFonts
This location is where your .sf2 SoundFont files should be in order to have
MIDI music in-game.  Once you put a .sf2 file here, you'll need to update
your Chocolate Descent config file (chocolatedescent.cfg) with the filename.
Note that you should not put the path information in the configuration file,
as Chocolate Descent will look in this directory for the filename specified
in chocolatedescent.cfg.
